    abstract       = {Nucleus segmentation of fluorescence microscopy is a critical step in quantifying measurements in cell biology. Automatic and accurate nucleus segmentation has powerful applications in analyzing intrinsic characterization in nucleus morphology. However, existing methods have limited capacity to perform accurate segmentation in challenging samples, such as noisy images and clumped nuclei. In this paper, inspired by the idea of cascaded U-Net (or W-Net) and its remarkable performance improvement in medical image segmentation, we proposed a novel framework called Attention-enhanced Simplified W-Net (ASW-Net), in which a cascade-like structure with between-net connections was used. Results showed that this lightweight model could reach remarkable segmentation performance in the BBBC039 testing set (aggregated Jaccard index, 0.90). In addition, our proposed framework performed better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation performance. Moreover, we further explored the effectiveness of our designed network by visualizing the deep features from the network. Notably, our proposed framework is open source.},

@article{UNetNuclei,
    abstract   = {Nuclei segmentation is a fundamental but challenging task in histopathological image analysis. One of the main problems is the existence of overlapping regions which increases the difficulty of independent nuclei separation. In this study, to solve the segmentation of nuclei and overlapping regions, we introduce a nuclei segmentation method based on two-stage learning framework consisting of two connected Stacked U-Nets (SUNets). The proposed SUNets consists of four parallel backbone nets, which are merged by the attention generation model. In the first stage, a Stacked U-Net is utilized to predict pixel-wise segmentation of nuclei. The output binary map together with RGB values of the original images are concatenated as the input of the second stage of SUNets. Due to the sizable imbalance of overlapping and background regions, the first network is trained with cross-entropy loss, while the second network is trained with focal loss. We applied the method on two publicly available datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance for nuclei segmentation--mean Aggregated Jaccard Index (AJI) results were 0.5965 and 0.6210, and F1 scores were 0.8247 and 0.8060, respectively; our method also segmented the overlapping regions between nuclei, with average AJI = 0.3254. The proposed two-stage learning framework outperforms many current segmentation methods, and the consistent good segmentation performance on images from different organs indicates the generalized adaptability of our approach.},
